This project is another example of learning to use [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) spiders in order to scrape data from a given website. I chose the results of international dart players from [Darts Database](www.dartsdatabase.co.uk) as I thought it could be interesting to try and map their success over time.

Similar to my previous project for scraping supermarket product data I began by retrieving the results of a single player. Once I had completed this task I expanded the script to follow links on the website and retrieve all player information from the most recent years.

The requested data was in the form of HTML and so was much easier to access in comparison to my Supermarket-Scraper which used javascript and .json files.

Again, any suggestions as to how I can improve the code are more than welcome!

Cheers.
