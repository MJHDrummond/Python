This project is used to automate the deleveling of pvp rank in South Parks Phone Destroyer. It was a nice example to practice image recognition in Python while implementing error checks if the image is not found etc.

Script has been updated to include a quit() command when the image searches have failed too many times and when a user determined rank has been reached.

Sometimes the image recognition fails as the PyAutoGui image locator requires that the images are perfect pixel matches. Unfortunately there is no way to change the confidence levels of the image recognition yet using this library so hopefully this gets updated in the future.

Again, any suggestions as to how I can improve the code are more than welcome!

Cheers.
