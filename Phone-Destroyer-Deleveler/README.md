This project is used to automate the deleveling of pvp rank in South Parks Phone Destroyer. It was a nice example to practice image recognition in Python while implementing error checks if the image is not found etc.

I plan to update the script to stop when:
1) There has been too many failed attempts.
2) A certain rank is reached as right now it continues indefinetly.

Again, any suggestions as to how I can improve the code are more than welcome!

Cheers.
