# Supermarket-Scraper
Project start date: 18 July 2017.

This project is geared towards learning how to scrape data from a website. I chose the [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/producten) website as we shop there and it will be useful to quickly compare prices and nutritional information of the products. This has been a steep learning curve as I began self-learning Python at the start of July but perseverance has paid off.

As the website uses javascript it took a while to find out how the data can be pulled. I ended up using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) spiders to access the url and eventually found the link used to retrieve the data (in json format) from somewhere else. 

To begin with I focused on a single product to get the code up and running which then saves the data to .csv for later processing. I will then build upon this script to eventually retrieve all product information.

For anyone reading this, if you have any suggestions as to how I can improve the code then please don't hesitate to get in touch!

Cheers.
