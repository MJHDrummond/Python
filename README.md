# Apartment-Webpage-Monitor
Project start date: 15 July 2017.

Uploaded/working: 17 July 2017.

My first fully working Python script and upload to GitHub.

The script is used to monitor an [apartment rental website](https://www.domica.nl/) and send an email when the number of propertry listings has been updated. 

If you see any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement please feel free to let me know.

Thanks!
